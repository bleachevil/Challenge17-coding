# Challenge17-coding (Computer Science for JavaScript: Regex)

## Introductory paragraph
Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that are used for matching character combinations in strings for text matching/searching. In JavaScript, regular expressions are search patterns (JavaScript objects) from sequences of characters. <br />

RegExp makes searching and matching of strings easier and faster. For example, in search engines, logs, editors, etc. thereâ€™s a need to filter/match texts easily and efficiently. This is where the RegExp patterns come in, defining search patterns with a sequence of characters.

## Summary

I will provide detail explaination of the components of following regex called "Matching an Email". <br />

Matching an Email: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components
Literal notation is one method of creating RegExp objects in JavaScript. This method involves the use of RegExp literal syntax. RegExp literal notation involves the enclosing of your expression in slashes (/) without the use of quotation marks. <br />
it also limited the regular experssion and applied slashes (/) at start and end of experssion.

### Anchors
dollar sign ($) is consider as anchors.
it applied in the end of "Matching an Email" which mean the string need to be end based on the condition provided (.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/)
({2,6}) this is the quantifiers which will explained below
### Quantifiers
the quantifiers ({2,6}) <br />
this quantifiers has the Curly brackets which mean that the character has been limited. and the number 2 and 6 in the curly brackets is to indicate the minimum 2 characters/Numbers and maximum 6 charaters/Numbers allowed.
in front of the quantifiers is a bracket expression  ([a-z\.]) which will explain below.
